# AimRT

Full project details on [aimrt.org](https://aimrt.org/)。

## Brief

- AimRT is a basic runtime framework for the field of modern robotics. It is developed based on modern C++, is lightweight and easy to deploy, and has more modern designs in resource management and control, asynchronous programming, deployment configuration, etc.
- AimRT is committed to integrating the research and development of various deployment scenarios such as robot end-side, edge end, and cloud. It serves modern AI- and cloud-based robot applications and provides modern and complete debugging and performance analysis tools, as well as good observability support.
- AimRT also provides a comprehensive plug-in development interface, which is highly scalable and compatible with ROS2, HTTP, Grpc and other traditional robot ecosystems or cloud service ecosystems, and supports progressive upgrades of your existing systems.

> - AimRT 是现代机器人技术领域的基本运行框架。它基于现代 C++ 开发，轻量级、易部署，在资源管理与控制、异步编程、部署配置等方面有更多现代设计。
> - AimRT 致力于整合机器人端侧、边缘端、云端等多种部署场景的研发。它服务于基于人工智能和云计算的现代机器人应用，提供现代化的完整调试和性能分析工具，以及良好的可观测性支持。
> - AimRT 还提供了完善的插件开发接口，可扩展性强，兼容 ROS2、HTTP、Grpc 等传统机器人生态系统或云服务生态系统，支持对现有系统的逐步升级。
